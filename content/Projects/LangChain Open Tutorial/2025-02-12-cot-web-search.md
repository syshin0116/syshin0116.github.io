## Overview

This tutorial demonstrates a chain-of-thought (**CoT**) based smart web search approach designed to build a **plan-and-execute** style QA chatbot. The system breaks down complex user queries into a sequence of actionable steps such as **search**, **extraction**, **reasoning**, and **response generation**. It leverages large language models to perform each task, ensuring that every phase of the process is handled efficiently and accurately.

  

Throughout the tutorial, you will learn how to set up your environment, install the necessary packages, and define key data models using **`Pydantic`**. These models enforce a structured workflow by representing each task step (e.g., **search**, **think**, and **respond**) and by specifying how references and final outputs should be formatted in Markdown.

  

The workflow is composed of multiple nodes, each responsible for a specific phase of the processing pipeline. You will see how the system:

  

1. Generates a plan from a user query

2. Retrieves raw information from the web

3. Extracts and summarizes the relevant data

4. Optionally refines the results through additional reasoning

5. Compiles a comprehensive final answer

  

The nodes are dynamically connected through a routing function that adapts to the current state of the process.

  

A key aspect of this tutorial is the integration of **asynchronous execution**, which allows the entire workflow to run in real time. This not only improves performance but also provides immediate feedback during long-running tasks, making it easier to monitor and debug the process.

  

### Key Features

  

- **Chain-of-Thought Query Expansion**: Breaks down complex queries into manageable steps.

- **Modular Workflow**: Separates the process into distinct nodes (planning, searching, extracting, reasoning, responding).

- **Asynchronous Execution**: Enables real-time monitoring and concurrency for improved performance.

- **Dynamic Task Routing**: Adapts the processing sequence based on the current state, ensuring each node is executed as needed.

- **Robust Data Modeling**: Uses `Pydantic` to ensure consistent data structures and type safety.

## Data Models and Type Definitions

  

This section establishes the foundations for the entire tutorial by defining the key data structures using `Pydantic`. Our workflow relies on these models to ensure consistent information flow:

  

- `TaskStep` tracks a single step (either *search*, *think*, or *respond*).

- `TaskSteps` holds a list of such steps.

- `SearchQuries`, `KeyInformation`, and `SearchResultData` model how we handle web search queries and their results.

- `Reference`and `FinalResponse` describe how we finalize and format the output response, including references.

  

Using these data models enforces structure, making the entire process easier to debug and maintain.

  
  

```python

from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

from typing import Literal

from langchain.tools import tool

from typing import List, Optional, Annotated

from langgraph.graph import MessagesState

import operator

from typing_extensions import TypedDict

from pprint import pprint

from IPython.display import Markdown, display

  
  

class TaskStep(BaseModel):

"""

Types:

- "search": Retrieve raw information from the web

- "think": (Optional) Further analyze or refine extracted data from search

- "respond": Generate the final answer

"""

  

id: str = Field(description="Unique identifier for the step")

description: str = Field(

description='Step description, e.g., "Search for latest AI news"'

)

)

)

  
  

class TaskSteps(BaseModel):

"""

"""

class SearchQuries(BaseModel):

"""

"""

  

search_queries: list = Field(

description="List of Queries that are optimized for web search. Must contain at least 1 and at most 3 queries."

)

  
  

class KeyInformation(BaseModel):

"""

"""

  

title: str = Field(..., description="The title of the search result")

key_information: Optional[str] = Field(

)

class SearchResultData(BaseModel):

"""

"""

  

query: str = Field(..., description="The search query that produced this result")

results: List[KeyInformation] = Field(

..., description="Extracted information from search results"

)

  
  

class Reference(BaseModel):

"""

"""

  

citation_id: int = Field(description="The citation id starting from 1")

title: str = Field(description="The title of the reference")

url: str = Field(description="The url of the reference")

  
  

class FinalResponse(BaseModel):

"""

"""

  

markdown: str = Field(

description="The markdown formatted final response with inline citations. If you add any headings, make sure to start at level (##)"

)

references: list[Reference] = Field(description="A list of references")

```

  

### Define Agent and Worker State

  

In this part, two distinct state models are defined: one for the overall agent and one for individual worker tasks.

  

We use two different states:

  

1. `AgentState`: Represents the overall flow of the conversation, including steps, search results, think results, and the final answer.

2. `WorkerState`: Manages the current task at a more granular level (e.g., one node’s execution).

  

This separation improves modularity and makes it simpler to track local vs. global information during a workflow run.

  
  

```python

class AgentState(MessagesState):

"""

The state of the agent.

Contains the steps, search result, think result, and answer.

"""

  

steps: Annotated[list, operator.add]

search_result: Annotated[list, operator.add]

think_result: Annotated[list, operator.add]

answer: Optional[str]

  
  

class WorkerState(TypedDict):

"""

The state of the worker.

Contains the steps and the current step.

"""

  

steps: Annotated[list, operator.add]

current_step: TaskStep

final_search_result: list

```

  

### Initialize Chat Models and Search Tool

We initialize two `ChatOpenAI` models:

  

- smart model: A more capable model (e.g., `gpt-4o`) used for planning or complex reasoning.

- fast model: A lighter model (e.g., `gpt-4o-mini`) used for simpler tasks or when we prioritize speed.

  

This allows you to balance quality versus cost and speed. For instance, plan generation might use **smart model**, while quick lookups or shorter tasks might use **fast model**.

  
  

```python

from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

  

smart_model = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o", temperature=0.5)

fast_model = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini", temperature=0.5)

```

  
  

```python

from langchain_community.tools import TavilySearchResults

  

# Initialize Tavily search tool

tavily = TavilySearchResults(

max_results=3,

search_depth="advanced",

include_answer=True,

include_raw_content=True,

include_images=False,

)

```

  

## Define Nodes for the Workflow

  

A node in this workflow is a single unit of functionality—such as “plan steps”, “search the web”, “think about results”, or “respond to user”. Splitting the entire chain-of-thought (CoT) approach into nodes makes the system easier to extend and debug.

  

### Plan Steps Node

The **plan steps node** is the entry point of the workflow. It takes the user's query and generates a structured plan outlining the necessary steps to answer it. These steps include creating search tasks, optional think tasks for deeper analysis, and a final respond task to craft the answer. A well-defined plan here is crucial for effective execution in later nodes.

  
  

```python

from datetime import datetime

from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage, SystemMessage

from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableConfig

  
  

async def plan_steps_node(state: AgentState, config: RunnableConfig):

"""

Generate a plan of steps for the research process.

The plan should include steps of type "search", and "respond".

Optionally, a "think" step may be included if further analysis is desired.

"""

instructions = f"""

You are an assistant specialized in breaking down complex queries into actionable steps.

  

Generate a plan of steps to find the answer to the user's query.

If the query is simple, you may directly create one "respond" step.

  

Divide the query into the following steps:

- First, create one or more "search" steps to retrieve raw information from the web.

- Optionally, create a "think" step to analyze the extracted data further.

- Finally, create a "respond" step to generate the final answer in markdown format.

  

Current date: {datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d")}.

"""

response = await smart_model.with_structured_output(TaskSteps).ainvoke(

[

SystemMessage(content=instructions),

HumanMessage(

content=state["messages"][0].content,

),

],

config,

)

print(f"🤖 Plan:")

pprint(response.steps)

return {"steps": response.steps}

```

  

### Search Node

  

This node handles external web search. It receives the step’s description, produces multiple queries, and calls the `TavilySearchResults` tool to get results. Each result is then summarized or filtered, before being passed on to the rest of the pipeline.

  

1. Generate multiple queries (to cover different angles).

2. Perform the searches asynchronously.

3. Store aggregated information for the next step.

  
  
  

```python

import json

from datetime import datetime

from langchain_core.messages import SystemMessage, HumanMessage

from typing import List

  
  

async def search_node(state: WorkerState, config) -> dict:

"""

Search node for the research process.

  

1. Generate multiple search queries for the current step.

2. For each query, asynchronously invoke the Tavily search tool and extract key information.

3. Store the aggregated search results into current_step.data.

"""

current_step = state.get("current_step")

  

# Step 1: Generate multiple search queries

system_instructions = f"""

You are an AI assistant specialized in generating search queries.

Based on the following step description, generate multiple relevant search queries.

Current date: {datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d")}.

"""

human_instructions = f"Current step: {current_step.description}"

  

response = await fast_model.with_structured_output(SearchQuries).ainvoke(

[

SystemMessage(content=system_instructions),

HumanMessage(content=human_instructions),

],

config,

)

search_queries: List[str] = response.search_queries

  

# Step 2: Perform Tavily search and extract key information

async def search_and_extract(query: str):

print(f"🔎 Searching Query: {query}")

result = await tavily.ainvoke(query)

system_instructions_extract = """

"""

human_instructions_extract = f"""

- Title: <title>

- Source URL: <url>

  

If the result is irrelevant, return "irrelevant".

"""

  

extract_result = await fast_model.with_structured_output(

SearchResultData

).ainvoke(

[

SystemMessage(content=system_instructions_extract),

HumanMessage(content=human_instructions_extract),

],

config,

)

  

return extract_result

  

# Step 3: Execute search queries concurrently

search_tasks = [search_and_extract(query) for query in search_queries]

aggregated_search_results: List[SearchResultData] = await asyncio.gather(

*search_tasks

)

  

# Store the extracted search results

search_result = [

{

"step_id": current_step.id,

"search_result": [

result.model_dump() for result in aggregated_search_results

],

}

]

  

return {"search_result": search_result}

```

  

### Collect Search Results Node

  

This optional node simply waits for all concurrent searches to finish and then aggregates the results. It does nothing beyond returning the existing state, but it ensures we have a single synchronization point before moving forward (useful in parallel “map” scenarios).

  
  

```python

async def collect_search_results_node(

state: AgentState, config: RunnableConfig

) -> dict:

"""

Collection node for the search process.

  

This node simply waits for all search results to be aggregated and then returns the state unchanged.

It does not perform any additional processing.

"""

return state

```

  

### Think Node

  

We optionally refine and analyze the data gathered from the search. If the user’s query is more complex, we insert a *think step* that leverages **fast_model** (or **smart_model**) to process the intermediate data. This can produce more concise or better-structured information to pass on to the final respond phase.

  
  
  

```python

async def think_node(state: WorkerState, config: RunnableConfig):

"""

Process extracted information for further analysis.

This node is executed if there is a pending "think" step.

"""

current_step = state.get("current_step")

  

# System and Human Instructions

system_instructions = """

You are an advanced reasoning AI designed to analyze and refine information.

Carefully evaluate the provided data to enhance its clarity and completeness.

Focus on refining the information relevant to the given objective.

"""

  

human_instructions = f"""

Objective: {current_step.description}

  

Based on the extracted data:

  

Search Results:

{state['final_search_result']}

  

Please analyze and refine this information to make it more useful for answering the final query.

"""

  

response = await fast_model.ainvoke(

[

SystemMessage(content=system_instructions),

HumanMessage(content=human_instructions),

],

config,

)

print(f"🧠 Think Result:")

  

# Display the think result

result_for_dislay = (

response.content[:1000] + "\n\n...output cut to prevent excessive output..."

if len(response.content) > 1000

else response.content

)

display(Markdown(result_for_dislay))

# Store thought result

think_result = [{"step_id": current_step.id, "think_result": response.content}]

  

return {"think_result": think_result}

```

  

### Response Node

  

Finally, we combine all steps, including the user’s query, search results, and optional *think* results, into a coherent answer. The answer is generated in Markdown, with inline citations and references appended at the end.

  

This step demonstrates how we can produce a well-formatted, easily readable response to the end user.

  
  

```python

async def response_node(state: AgentState, config: RunnableConfig):

"""

This node compiles all intermediate data (steps, search results, think results)

into a final answer. The answer is formatted in Markdown, including inline

citations pointing to references at the bottom.

  

1. system_instructions: Provides a template for how the final answer

should look, with examples of inline citations.

1. human_instructions: Provides user context (query) and any relevant

steps or data collected throughout the workflow.

  

The node uses the 'smart_model' (gpt-4o) with structured output to produce

a FinalResponse object, which contains both Markdown text and a list of

references.

"""

system_instructions = """

2. If you need to include headings, start at (##) to avoid overshadowing existing documentation levels.

3. Write succinctly and accurately, ensuring any claims are supported by the references.

4. Example inline citation usage:

This is a sentence with a reference to a source[1] and another reference[2].

[1]: [Title of Source 1](http://example.com/source1)

[2]: [Title of Source 2](http://example.com/source2)

"""

  

# Human instructions that provide specific context (query, steps, results, etc.)

human_instructions = f"""

User Query: {state["messages"][0].content}

{state["steps"]}

  

Search Results:

{state["search_result"]}

  

Think Results:

"""

  

# Invoke the smart model to produce structured output (FinalResponse)

response = await smart_model.with_structured_output(FinalResponse).ainvoke(

[

SystemMessage(content=system_instructions),

HumanMessage(content=human_instructions),

],

config,

)

  

# Print the final Markdown answer

print(f"📝 Final Response:")

display(Markdown(response.markdown))

print()

print("References:\n")

for ref in response.references:

print(f"[{ref.citation_id}] {ref.title}\n {ref.url}\n")

  

# Return the structured FinalResponse object as "answer"

return {"answer": response}

```

  

## Route Tasks and Compile Workflow

  

This portion of the tutorial shows how to:

  

1. Decide which step should execute next (the task router).

2. Build our entire workflow as a graph, using the `StateGraph` class.

3. Visualize the graph to confirm all nodes connect properly.

  

Combining these elements provides a clear flow from plan → search → optional think → respond, with conditionals for concurrency.

  

### Task Router Function

  

The router examines all pending steps. If we find one or more search steps (marked pending), we dispatch them concurrently using the `Send` object. If no search steps remain, we look for think or respond steps. When none remain, we conclude by returning `END`.

  

This ensures the system adapts dynamically: if a step is done, it moves on to the next relevant step without manual intervention.

  
  
  

```python

from langgraph.constants import Send

from langgraph.graph import END

  
  

def task_router(state):

"""

Route to the appropriate node based on the pending step type.

- If a pending "search" step exists, dispatch it (via Send) so that search_node

executes and then flows automatically into extraction_node.

- Else if a pending "think" step exists, route to think_node.

- Else if a pending "respond" step exists, route to response_node.

- If no pending steps remain, return END.

"""

steps_list = state.get("steps", [])

  

pending_search = [

step

for step in steps_list

if step.status == "pending" and step.type == "search"

]

if pending_search:

for step in pending_search:

step.status = "complete" # Update status before dispatching

return [

Send("search_node", {"steps": steps_list, "current_step": step})

for step in pending_search

]

else:

for step in steps_list:

if step.status == "pending":

if step.type == "think":

step.status = "complete"

return Send(

"think_node",

{

"steps": steps_list,

"current_step": step,

"final_search_result": state.get("search_result", []),

},

)

elif step.type == "respond":

return "response_node"

return END

```

  

### Build Workflow Graph

  

We add nodes to the workflow using `.add_node(...)`, specify the start node (plan_steps_node), and link them with `.add_edge(...)` or `.add_conditional_edges(...)`. Then we compile with a `MemorySaver` checkpoint mechanism (optional) to track states.

  

Graph-based logic clarifies how each node transitions to the next, whether conditionally or directly.

  
  
  

```python

from langgraph.graph import StateGraph

from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver

  

workflow = StateGraph(AgentState)

  

# Define nodes

workflow.add_node("plan_steps_node", plan_steps_node)

workflow.add_node("search_node", search_node)

workflow.add_node("collect_search_results_node", collect_search_results_node)

workflow.add_node("think_node", think_node)

workflow.add_node("response_node", response_node)

  

# Set entry point

workflow.set_entry_point("plan_steps_node")

  

# After planning, route according to pending step types.

workflow.add_conditional_edges(

"plan_steps_node", task_router, ["search_node", "think_node", "response_node"]

)

  

# Search node flows into collect_search_results_node

workflow.add_edge("search_node", "collect_search_results_node")

  

# Ensure search_node automatically flows back into task_router

workflow.add_conditional_edges(

"collect_search_results_node", task_router, ["think_node", "response_node"]

)

  

# If a think step exists, it flows to the response node.

workflow.add_edge("think_node", "response_node")

  

# Response node marks the end.

workflow.add_edge("response_node", END)

  

# Compile the workflow

memory = MemorySaver()

graph = workflow.compile(checkpointer=memory)

```

  

### Visualize Graph

  

For debugging or documentation, we can generate a diagram of our graph’s nodes and edges. This makes it easy to see the plan from start to finish, identify concurrency, and check for mistakes (like a node missing an edge to the final stage).

  
  

```python

from langchain_opentutorial.graphs import visualize_graph

  

visualize_graph(graph)

```

  
  ![](https://i.imgur.com/gXxyDLr.png)

  
  

## Run Workflow

  

Here, we demonstrate the end-to-end execution:

  

1. **Configure** the run parameters (e.g., thread IDs or optional debugging).

2. **Initialize** the graph with the user’s query.

3. **Execute** asynchronously, streaming real-time results.

  

Finally, we show how to examine the final state—looking at the produced Markdown answer and references.

  
  

### Streaming Graph Execution

  

We define `astream_graph(...)` to retrieve and print updates during the run. Each node’s outputs appear in real time, letting you monitor progress and debug problems such as missing data or infinite loops.

  
  

```python

from typing import Any, Dict, List, Callable

from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableConfig

from langgraph.graph.state import CompiledStateGraph

  
  

async def astream_graph(

graph: CompiledStateGraph,

inputs: Dict[str, Any],

config: RunnableConfig,

node_names: List[str] = [],

callback: Callable[[Dict[str, str]], None] = None,

):

"""

Asynchronously streams the execution results of a LangGraph.

  

Parameters:

- graph (CompiledStateGraph): The compiled LangGraph to be executed.

- inputs (dict): The input data dictionary to be passed to the graph.

- config (RunnableConfig): Execution configuration.

- node_names (List[str], optional): List of node names to filter output (empty list means all nodes).

- callback (Callable[[Dict[str, str]], None], optional): A callback function for processing each chunk.

The callback receives a dictionary with keys "node" (str) and "content" (str).

  

Returns:

- None: This function prints the streaming output but does not return any value.

"""

prev_node = ""

async for chunk_msg, metadata in graph.astream(

inputs, config, stream_mode="messages"

):

curr_node = metadata["langgraph_node"]

  

# Process only the specified nodes if node_names is not empty

if not node_names or curr_node in node_names:

if callback:

callback({"node": curr_node, "content": chunk_msg.content})

else:

# Print a header whenever the node changes

if curr_node != prev_node:

print("\n" + "=" * 60)

print(f"🔄 Node: \033[1;36m{curr_node}\033[0m 🔄")

print("=" * 60)

  

prev_node = curr_node

```

  

### Configure and Run Workflow Graph

  

We create a `config`, store it in `memory` if needed, and supply the user’s query. The asynchronous execution triggers each node in the correct order.

  
  

```python

# Configuration

config = {

"configurable": {

"thread_id": 1, # temporary thread ID for testing

},

}

  

inputs = AgentState(

messages=[

HumanMessage(

content="How did the implementation of artificial intelligence in supply chain management during the COVID-19 pandemic impact global trade efficiency, and what are the current trends and future projections for AI-driven supply chains in the next decade?"

)

],

steps=[],

answer=None,

)

```
