### Code
#### Chat API : OpenAI


Let's start with a direct API calls to OpenAI.


```python

def get_completion(prompt, model=llm_model):

	messages = [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]

	response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(

		model=model,

		messages=messages,

		temperature=0,

	)

	return response.choices[0].message["content"]

```

  
  

```python
get_completion("What is 1+1?")
```

  

	'As an AI language model, I can tell you that the answer to 1+1 is 2.'

  
  
  
  

```python

customer_email = """

Arrr, I be fuming that me blender lid \

flew off and splattered me kitchen walls \

with smoothie! And to make matters worse,\

the warranty don't cover the cost of \

cleaning up me kitchen. I need yer help \

right now, matey!

"""

```

#### Output Parsers

  

Let's start with defining how we would like the LLM output to look like:

  
  

```python

{

"gift": False,

"delivery_days": 5,

"price_value": "pretty affordable!"

}

```

```python

customer_review = """\

This leaf blower is pretty amazing. It has four settings:\

candle blower, gentle breeze, windy city, and tornado. \

It arrived in two days, just in time for my wife's \

anniversary present. \

I think my wife liked it so much she was speechless. \

So far I've been the only one using it, and I've been \

using it every other morning to clear the leaves on our lawn. \

It's slightly more expensive than the other leaf blowers \

out there, but I think it's worth it for the extra features.

"""

  

review_template = """\

For the following text, extract the following information:

  

gift: Was the item purchased as a gift for someone else? \

Answer True if yes, False if not or unknown.

  

delivery_days: How many days did it take for the product \

to arrive? If this information is not found, output -1.

  

price_value: Extract any sentences about the value or price,\

and output them as a comma separated Python list.

  

Format the output as JSON with the following keys:

gift

delivery_days

price_value

  

text: {text}

"""

```

  
  

```python

from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate

  

prompt_template = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(review_template)

print(prompt_template)

```

  

	input_variables=['text'] output_parser=None partial_variables={} messages=[HumanMessagePromptTemplate(prompt=PromptTemplate(input_variables=['text'], output_parser=None, partial_variables={}, template='For the following text, extract the following information:\n\ngift: Was the item purchased as a gift for someone else?

	"delivery_days": 2,
	
	"price_value": ["It's slightly more expensive than the other leaf blowers out there, but I think it's worth it for the extra features."]
	
	}

  
  
  

```python

	str

  
  
  
  

```python

# You will get an error by running this line of code

# because'gift' is not a dictionary

# 'gift' is a string

response.content.get('gift')

```

##### Parse the LLM output string into a Python dictionary

  
  

```python

from langchain.output_parsers import ResponseSchema

from langchain.output_parsers import StructuredOutputParser

```

  
  

```python

gift_schema = ResponseSchema(name="gift",

description="Was the item purchased\

as a gift for someone else? \

False if not or unknown.")

delivery_days_schema = ResponseSchema(name="delivery_days",

description="How many days\

did it take for the product\

to arrive? If this \

information is not found,\

output -1.")

price_value_schema = ResponseSchema(name="price_value",

description="Extract any\

sentences about the value or \

price, and output them as a \

comma separated Python list.")

  

response_schemas = [gift_schema,

delivery_days_schema,

price_value_schema]

```

  
  

```python

output_parser = StructuredOutputParser.from_response_schemas(response_schemas)

```

  
  

```python

format_instructions = output_parser.get_format_instructions()

```

  
  

```python

print(format_instructions)

## Memory

Large Language Models are 'stateless'
- Each transaction is independent

Chatbots appear to have memory by providing the full conversation as 'context'

>#### Large Language Models (LLMs)와 Stateless의 의미
>
>- **독립적 요청 처리**: LLMs의 stateless 특성은 각 요청을 이전의 상호작용과 독립적으로 처리한다는 것을 의미
>- **맥락 부재**: 모델은 주어진 입력만을 기반으로 응답을 생성하며, 이전 요청의 맥락은 고려하지 않음
>- **세션 상태 유지 부재**: LLMs는 사용자 세션 정보나 이전 상호작용을 기억하지 않음
>
>##### Stateless 모델의 장점
>
>- **단순성과 확장성**: 요청 간 상태 정보 공유가 필요 없어 시스템 설계가 단순하고 확장이 용이
>- **무상태성**: 상태 정보의 저장과 관리를 최소화해 시스템의 신뢰성과 가용성 향상
>
>##### Stateless 모델의 단점
>
>- **맥락 제한**: 이전 맥락을 고려하지 않아 긴 대화나 복잡한 상호작용 처리에 제한이 있을 수 있음
>- **상태 유지 필요성**: 특정 애플리케이션에서 사용자 맥락이 중요할 경우, 외부 시스템을 통한 상태 정보 관리가 필요
>
>LLMs의 stateless 특성은 강력한 언어 처리 능력을 제공하지만, 복잡한 상호작용을 처리하기 위해서는 상태 정보의 관>리가 필요할 수 있음


LangChain provides several kinds of 'memory' to store and accumulate the conversation

```python
from langchain.char_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.chains import ConversationChain
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory

llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0.0)
memory = ConversationBufferMemory()
conversation = ConversationChain(llm=llm,
								 memory=memory,
								 verbose=False
)

```

### Outline[](https://s172-31-10-142p57746.lab-aws-production.deeplearning.ai/notebooks/L2-Memory.ipynb#Outline)

#### Memory

- ConversationBufferMemory
	- This memory allows for storing of messages and then extracts the messages in a variable.
- ConversationBufferWindowMemory
	- This memory keeps a list of the interactions of the conversation over time. It only uses the last K interactions.
- ConversationTokenBufferMemory
	- This memory keeps a buffer of recent interactions in memory, and uses token length rather than number of interactions to determine when to flush interactions.
- ConversationSummaryMemory
	- This memory creates a summary of the conversation over time.

#### Additional Memory Types
- Vector data memory
	- Stores text (from conversation or elsewhere) in a vector database and retrieves the most relevant blocks of text.
- Entity memories
	- Using an LLM, it remembers details about specific entities.

You can also use multiple memories at one time.

E.g., Conversation memory + Entity memory to recall individuals.

You can also store the conversation in a conventional database (such as key-value store or SQL)
### Code


  

#### ConversationBufferMemory

  
  

```python

import os

  

from dotenv import load_dotenv, find_dotenv

_ = load_dotenv(find_dotenv()) # read local .env file

  

import warnings

warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')

```

  

Note: LLM's do not always produce the same results. When executing the code in your notebook, you may get slightly different answers that those in the video.

  
  

```python

# account for deprecation of LLM model

import datetime

# Get the current date

current_date = datetime.datetime.now().date()

  

# Define the date after which the model should be set to "gpt-3.5-turbo"

target_date = datetime.date(2024, 6, 12)

  

# Set the model variable based on the current date

if current_date > target_date:

llm_model = "gpt-3.5-turbo"

else:

llm_model = "gpt-3.5-turbo-0301"

```

## Chains

### Sequential Chains
Sequential chain is another type of chains. The idea is to combine multiple chains where the
output of the one chain is the input of the next chain.

There is two type of sequential chains:
1. SimpleSequentialChain: Single input/output
2. SequentialChain: multiple inputs/outputs

![](https://i.imgur.com/v2JRuE4.png)



```python
from langchain.chains import SimpleSequentialChain

    a company that makes {product}?"
)

# Chain 1

### Code

#### LangChain: Q&A over Documents

  

An example might be a tool that would allow you to query a product catalog for items of interest.

  
  

```python

#pip install --upgrade langchain

```

  
  

```python

import os

  

from dotenv import load_dotenv, find_dotenv

_ = load_dotenv(find_dotenv()) # read local .env file

```

  

Note: LLM's do not always produce the same results. When executing the code in your notebook, you may get slightly different answers that those in the video.

  
  

```python

# account for deprecation of LLM model

import datetime

# Get the current date

current_date = datetime.datetime.now().date()

  

# Define the date after which the model should be set to "gpt-3.5-turbo"

target_date = datetime.date(2024, 6, 12)

  

# Set the model variable based on the current date

if current_date > target_date:

llm_model = "gpt-3.5-turbo"

else:

llm_model = "gpt-3.5-turbo-0301"

```

  
  

```python

from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA

from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI

from langchain.document_loaders import CSVLoader

from langchain.vectorstores import DocArrayInMemorySearch

from IPython.display import display, Markdown

from langchain.llms import OpenAI

```

  
  

```python

file = 'OutdoorClothingCatalog_1000.csv'

loader = CSVLoader(file_path=file)

```

  
  

```python

from langchain.indexes import VectorstoreIndexCreator

```

  
  

```python

#pip install docarray

```

  
  

```python

index = VectorstoreIndexCreator(

vectorstore_cls=DocArrayInMemorySearch

).from_loaders([loader])

```

  
  

```python

query ="Please list all your shirts with sun protection \

in a table in markdown and summarize each one."

```

  

**Note**:

- The notebook uses `langchain==0.0.179` and `openai==0.27.7`

- For these library versions, `VectorstoreIndexCreator` uses `text-davinci-003` as the base model, which has been deprecated since 1 January 2024.

- The replacement model, `gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct` will be used instead for the `query`.

- The `response` format might be different than the video because of this replacement model.

  
  

```python

llm_replacement_model = OpenAI(temperature=0,

model='gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct')

  

response = index.query(query,

llm = llm_replacement_model)

```

  
  

```python

## Evaulation

### Outline:

* Example generation

* Manual evaluation (and debuging)

* LLM-assisted evaluation

* LangChain evaluation platform

### Code
  
```python

import os

  

from dotenv import load_dotenv, find_dotenv

_ = load_dotenv(find_dotenv()) # read local .env file

```

  

Note: LLM's do not always produce the same results. When executing the code in your notebook, you may get slightly different answers that those in the video.

  
  

```python

# account for deprecation of LLM model

import datetime

# Get the current date

current_date = datetime.datetime.now().date()

  

# Define the date after which the model should be set to "gpt-3.5-turbo"

target_date = datetime.date(2024, 6, 12)

  

# Set the model variable based on the current date

if current_date > target_date:

llm_model = "gpt-3.5-turbo"

else:

llm_model = "gpt-3.5-turbo-0301"

```

  

#### Create our QandA application

	Page: Machine learning
	Summary: Machine learning (ML) is a field of study in artificial intelligence concerned with the development and study of statistical algorithms that can learn from data and generalize to unseen data, and thus perform tasks without explicit instructions. Recently, generative artificial neural networks have been able to surpass many previous approaches in performance.Machine learning approaches have been applied to many fields including large language models (LLM), computer vision, speech recognition, email filtering, agriculture, and medicine, where it is too costly to develop algorithms to perform the needed tasks. ML is known in its application across business problems under the name predictive analytics. Although not all machine learning is statistically based, computational statistics is an important source of the field's methods.
	The mathematical foundations of ML are provided by mathematical optimization (mathematical programming) methods. Data mining is a related (parallel) field of study, focusing on exploratory data analysis (EDA) through unsupervised learning. From a theoretical point of view Probably approximately correct (PAC) learning provides a framework for describing machine learning.
	
	Page: Outline of machine learning
	Summary: The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to machine learning:
	Machine learning – subfield of soft computing within computer science that evolved from the study of pattern recognition and computational learning theory in artificial intelligence. In 1959, Arthur Samuel defined machine learning as a "field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed". Machine learning explores the study and construction of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on data. Such algorithms operate by building a model from an example training set of input observations in order to make data-driven predictions or decisions expressed as outputs, rather than following strictly static program instructions.
	Thought:The book "Machine Learning" was written by Tom M. Mitchell.
	
	Final Answer: Tom M. Mitchell wrote the book "Machine Learning".
