### How to choose an AWS Region?

Question: If you need to launch a new application, where should you do it?

1. Compliance with data governmance and legal requirements:
	* ex) if you want your data to leave a specific region
2. Proximity to customers(close to target users):
	* reduced latency
3. Available Services witin a region:
	* new services and new feature aren't available in very Region
4. Pricing: 
	* pricing varies region to region and is transparent in the sevice pricing page 

### AWS Availability Zones

* Each region has multiple ZA(availability zones) example:
	* ap-southeast-2a
	* ap-southeast-2b

Each availability zones(ZA):

* is one or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity
* is sesparate from each other -> isolated from disasters
* is connected with high bandwidth, ultra-low latency networking


## IAM & AWS CLI
### IAM: Users & Groups

* IAM : Identity and Access Management, Gloabal service
* Root account : created by default, shouldn't be used or shared
* Users are people within your organization, and can be grouped
* Groups can only contain users, not other groups
* Users don't have to belong to a group
* Users can belong to multiple groups

Organizing Users:
* best not to use Root id (security reasons)
* instead, create a group called admin with all permissions and create a user in it

Account Alias: an account nickname user can create

* once created, sign-in url is created below
